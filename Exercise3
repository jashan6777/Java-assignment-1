//In the code above, we have an Athlete class representing an athlete with name, age, and runningDistanceEachDay properties. Then, we have an AthleteQueue class that uses the LinkedList data structure provided by Java to manage the queue of athletes.



//The enqueue method allows you to add an athlete to the end of the queue, and the dequeue method removes and returns the athlete at the front of the queue. The isEmpty method checks if the queue is empty, and the size method returns the number of athletes in the queue. Finally, the peek method returns the athlete at the front of the queue without removing it.



//You can use the AthleteQueue class as follows:
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        QueueManager athleteQueue = new QueueManager();



        // Enqueuing athletes

        Athlete athlete1 = new Athlete("Athlete 1", 25, 10);

        Athlete athlete2 = new Athlete("Athlete 2", 30, 8);

        athleteQueue.enqueue(athlete1);

        athleteQueue.enqueue(athlete2);



        System.out.println("Queue size: " + athleteQueue.size());
// Dequeuing an athlete

        Athlete dequeuedAthlete = athleteQueue.dequeue();

        System.out.println("Dequeued athlete: " + dequeuedAthlete.name);



        // Checking if the queue is empty

        System.out.println("Is queue empty? " + athleteQueue.isEmpty());



        // Peeking at the front athlete

        Athlete frontAthlete = athleteQueue.peek();

        System.out.println("Front athlete: " + frontAthlete.name);
 Athlete dequeuedAthlete2 = athleteQueue.dequeue();

        System.out.println("Dequeued athlete: " + dequeuedAthlete2.name);

        // Checking if the queue is empty

        System.out.println("Is queue empty? " + athleteQueue.isEmpty());



    }
